# SentenceKit

SentenceKit is an iOS framework for building user interfaces with natural language. This type of UI has been used successfully by apps like Beats by Dre (pre Apple Music) and Philz Coffee; both of which served as inspirations for this project. Natural language interfaces enjoy the advantage of feeling instantly familiar to users. If you can read, you already know how to use it. NLI's can also help to provide structure to the UX, as sentences are inherently narrative. They're fun to develop with, too, because you have to step into the user's story in order to compose the sentences about what they're doing inside of your application. 

The goal in designing the SentenceKit API was to remove as much overhead as possible from the process of turning those user stories in to a functional UI while still allowing for customization and extension.
